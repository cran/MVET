Description: Multivariate estimation and testing, currently a package for testing parametric data. To deal with parametric data, various multivariate normality tests and outlier detection are performed and visualized using the 'ggplot2' package. Homogeneity tests for covariance matrices are also possible, as well as the Hotelling's T-square test and the multivariate analysis of variance test. We are exploring additional tests and visualization techniques, such as profile analysis and randomized complete block design, to be made available in the future and making them easily accessible to users.
